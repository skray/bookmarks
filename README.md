[Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/) app to track books I want to read

This is a way for me to learn Ionic and Angular 2, while building an app that I've been wanting for a long time.
Much of this is very specific to the things I care about when trying to track the books I want to read, but it is
out here for anyone who wants to try to use it, or to see an example Ionic 2 app.
